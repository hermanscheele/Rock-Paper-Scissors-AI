Rock-Paper-Scissors AI Game with Computer Vision

This project is an interactive rock-paper-scissors game that utilizes computer vision, TensorFlow, and a webcam for gesture recognition. The game allows players to play against the computer by showing hand gestures (rock, paper, or scissors) to the webcam. Using TensorFlowâ€™s handpose model and finger gesture recognition via the Fingerpose library, the app detects the player's hand gestures in real-time. Once the gesture is identified, the computer randomly selects its choice, and the game determines the winner based on the traditional rules of rock-paper-scissors. The game is built using React and TensorFlow.js.
